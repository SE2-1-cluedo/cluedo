A simple implementation of the boardgame cluedo with the following specifics:

The Dice:
At the beginning of every round a window will pop up asking you to roll the dice. To accomplish that you have two options:
1) Click the dice.
2) Shake your phone.
Now you are able to move your character through the 9 rooms to find clues. The max. number of the steps per roll is 3 or you roll
the magnifying glass which will give the information which player a certain card has.

Move:
After the dice throw you can use the yellow arrows to move your character.

The Swiping Motions:
To make it easier to overview everything you can use three swiping motions to see your cards, notepad and accusation.\n
Swipe Right: There you can see your notepad. Swipe left to get back to the board.
Swipe Left: To make your suspicion and accusation. Swipe right to get back to the board.
Swipe Up: Open your three to six cards.

Notepad:
In the Notepad you can use Checkboxes to remember your clues for the murderer and accusation.

Suspicion/Accusation:
After the left swipe you are in the accusation menu. Here you can select the weapon, the culprit and the room which is automatically your current room.
